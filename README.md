# herizon-refraction
## Description
This project was a refraction of the heriseon webpage; html and CSS were updated with more recent elements/terms. I learned how to deploy pages into download things from the gitlab repo, create my own github repository, and add, commit, and push files into github from my local repository.

## Installation

 The webpage should be viewable once accessed via link. 

## Usage

You can click links to be brought to other parts of the webpage!
